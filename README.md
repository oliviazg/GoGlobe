Development Log for Evelyn Chen:
--------------------------------
D1: I merged main GoGlobe (created by Olivia) into my own branch and added the instance variables and main methods for GoGlobe. I also started coding generateMaze(double density).

D2: I continued working on GoGlobe, updating setup and the configuration with keys.

D3: I added Time configuration and continued to work on the mazeGenerator and Portal in the main class.

D4: I created the Controller class and updated the main GoGlobe class.

D5 - D8: I worked with Olivia via live coding to fix mazeGenerator, portal, ball movement, difficulty levels, timer, borders, keyPressed and keyReleased.
