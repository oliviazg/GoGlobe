Development Log for Evelyn Chen:
--------------------------------
D1: I merged main GoGlobe (created by Olivia) into my own branch and added the instance variables and main methods for GoGlobe. I also started coding generateMaze(double density).

D2: I continued working on GoGlobe, updating setup and the configuration with keys.

D3: I added Time configuration and continued to work on the mazeGenerator and Portal in the main class.

D4: I created the Controller class and updated the main GoGlobe class.

D5 - D8: I worked with Olivia via live coding to fix mazeGenerator, portal, ball movement, difficulty levels, timer, borders, keyPressed and keyReleased.

D9: I worked on the Wind class, but bumped into Processing.app errors that I could not solve on my own.

D10: I continued to work on displaying the Wind element in the main and adding the effects to the Ball.

Development Log for Olivia Zheng:

D1: I merged Evelyn's updated GoGlobe with my own branch. I filled in most of the variables and methods for Ball and Obstacle, and added a few new variables and methods as well.

D2: I created the Wind class and added and updated Ball, Obstacle, and Wind methods.

D3: I hand-sketched Ball and Obstacle designs.

D4: I added pngs to Ball and Obstacle display() methods.

D5 - 8: Got Maze to function properly; added maze, ball, and obstacles to setup and draw; got the maze and the ball to function for the MVP.

D9 - I edited the Obstacle class-still doesn't work.

D10 - I got the Obstacle class to show up in the maze and to move. I also created an Obstacle ArrayList in GoGlobe to generate numerous Obstacles (doesn't work yet).

D11 - Decremented health when jump toggled
=======
D5 - 8: Met with Evelyn online: worked out Maze generator and level advancement; added Ball, Obstacle, and Maze to setup and draw in GoGlobe; got Ball and Maze generator to work for our MVP.
